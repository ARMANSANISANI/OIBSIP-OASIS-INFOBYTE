# OIBSIP-OASIS-INFOBYTE
Web development and design internship

Completing these projects was an enriching experience, covering design, interactivity, and backend fundamentals. I built a #Netflix landing page focusing on responsive layout, a #temperature converter enhancing JavaScript skills, and a #scientific calculator for complex calculations. The #tribute page taught content presentation, while the #to-do app involved dynamic data handling. With login authentication, I learned security basics, and the portfolio brought it all together to showcase my work. Each project expanded my skills and prepared me for more advanced web development tasks.


## LANDING PAGE - NETFLIX --

Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site allows users to quickly and accurately convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin units. The website features a clean, responsive design that adjusts to various devices, ensuring accessibility across screen sizes. Input validation and instant conversion results enhance the user experience, making temperature conversions seamless. This tool is designed to be practical, visually appealing, and highly intuitive for users needing quick temperature conversions.

## CALCULATOR SCIENTIFIC --
